# A small Javascript website that allows you to easily create multiline Slackbot emojis.

_This was originally attempted to be built in Python but unfortunately the library didn't work_

## The Project:

To use the open source [image-splitter](https://github.com/RuyiLi/image-splitter) Javascript library to split the image, and produce a string to add to Slack along with the emojis!
