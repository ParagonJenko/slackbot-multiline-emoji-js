# A small Javascript website that allows you to easily create multiline Slackbot emojis.

A tool that splits an image into square files - unlike the predecessor by [RuyiLi](https://github.com/RuyiLi/image-splitter) this does not support gifs at this time.

Upload an image, select your squares and it will save the squares into a zip file.

## Future Ideas

I'd like to refactor the actual splitting code, it's messy and taken from another persons work to fit my use case.
